	<h1>Jarad Asselin's Bio</h1>
<h3>
	I am a senior at Tufts University majoring in Cognitive and Brain Sciences. My hometown is Milford, NH and I spend a good amount of my time in southern Maine. I am a huge Boston sports fan. As a younger man, I spent a lot of time playing organized sports like basketball and track and field, but now I surf yeeww. After my graduation in May, I plan to work in Talloires, France for the summer at the Tufts European Center. I am looking for full-time employment in recyclable materials or an equally environmentally conscious field.
